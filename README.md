# Cryptoy

Cryptoy was built as part of my Final Year Project at NTU. It is a gamified
application that teaches beginners about cryptography.

## How to Start?

First, clone the project:

### `git clone https://github.com/GwynethAXY/cryptoy.git`

Then, install dependencies:

### `npm install`

Finally, run the app in development mode:
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000/#/home](http://localhost:3000/#/home) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
